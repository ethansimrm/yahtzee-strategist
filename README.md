# yahtzee-strategist

This is a strategy planner for the first round of Yahtzee - a game where you have five dice and you need to hold some strategically - and reroll the others - to get the desired total. 

You can play it at https://cardgames.io/yahtzee/, and see how this planner might help you (or probably confirm what you're already inclined to do).

You can run it in IDLE - just download the SimpleGUICS2Pygame package.
