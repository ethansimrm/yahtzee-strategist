# yahtzee-strategist

This is a strategy planner for the first round of Yahtzee - a game where you have five dice and you need to hold some strategically - and reroll the others - to get the desired total. 

You can play it at https://cardgames.io/yahtzee/, and see how this planner might help you (or probably confirm what you're already inclined to do).

You can run this at https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_dsogYuZPDf_20.py, using the CodeSkulptor browser-based IDE, which was created by the Rice University Department of Computer Science; alternatively, you can run it in IDLE using my .py file - just download the SimpleGUICS2Pygame package.
